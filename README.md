# Inkrust

An SVG editor and animator written in Rust.

## Goal
Create a standards compliant SVG editor similar to Inkscape. The main focus will be on creating an animation viewer and editor that can embed Javascript or SVG-SMIL into the SVG file allowing the animations to be viewed in any standards compliant web browser.
